This is a 6mans Rocket League rank guessing website created by me, Landshark.

I created this website using React and Node.js, as well as Google Drives to scale my video storage solution at the moment.

All of my code is here for those who are curious, as it is quite simple but it was a fun project for me to work on.

I hope you enjoy!
