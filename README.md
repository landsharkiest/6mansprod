This is a 6mans Rocket League rank guessing website created by me, Landshark.

I created this website using React and Node.js/Express, React-Dropzone for file uploading, as well as PostgresSQL and Amazon RDS for storage solutions.

All of my code is here for those who are curious, as it is quite simple but it was a fun project for me to work on.

I hope you enjoy!
